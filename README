* INTRODUCTION
SeekGzip provides a utility and library for random seek on gzip
streams. Because gzip streams do not support random seek, SeekGzip
builds an index file for a gzip file. An index file has a postfix
".idx" to the corresponding gzip file. The SeekGzip API provides
the functionality for building index files, seeking on a gzip stream
(with an index file associated), and reading data from the gzip stream.

SeekGzip also provides a C++/SWIG API for reading (seekable) gzip
streams.


* HOW TO BUILD THE UTILITY
$ make


* HOW TO USE THE UTILITY

(1) Building an index for a gzip file
$ seekgzip -b <FILE>
This builds an index file for random seek for the specified gzip file.
This utility creates an index file ${FILE}.idx

(2) Reading the data in the specified range
$ seekgzip <FILE> [BEGIN:END]
This reads the data in the gzip file ${FILE} from the offset ${BEGIN}
to ${END}.
